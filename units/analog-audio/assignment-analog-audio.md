2. Complete [**Learning Synths \(Ableton interactive learning\)**](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/)**.**
3. With great patience and focus, slowly work your way through understanding \*how\* the instrument in the [**playground**](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/playground) works in the following manner:
   * click on the menu in the bottom right \(four squares\)
     * Preset: Default
     * Sequence: Midtone
   * push play
   * work your way through the instrument starting with the top left going down, adjusting only one parameter at a time ... do no move on to adjusting the next parameter until you completely understand the one you are on \(you may want to put the parameter back to it's home/neutral position before moving on to the next\)
