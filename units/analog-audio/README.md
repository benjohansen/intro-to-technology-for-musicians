# 4. Analog Audio

1. What does the equal-loudness contour \(originally called the _Fletcher—Munson curve_\) refer to? What does this have to do with Pink Noise vs. White Noise?
   * What unit is used to indicate a ratio of the following?: _silence to the perceived loudness of a sound_ \[for humans\] ... provide at least 5 examples of the loudness levels of things/environments.
   * What is the frequency range of human hearing?
2. **Provide a drawing that illustrates a time-domain waveform representation of a sound wave \(label the following on your drawing: compression, rarefaction, zero crossing, wavelength, and amplitude\).**
3. Describe how a sound is initially created by \*your\* instrument and all it goes through \(transductions\) for another person to perceive it in their brain \(that means you’ll have to also include how the ear works\).
4. How is a spectrogram \(frequency domain\) different than a waveform \(time domain\)?
   * What is Fourier analysis?
5. What are the terms aperiodic and periodic used to describe in the sound medium? What is something that produces an aperiodic waveform? What is something that produces a periodic waveform?
6. Define complex tone \(or complex wave form\) by comparing it to a sine wave.
   * Define "overtone" and "harmonic."
   * Define "timbre."
7. **Draw a diagram of a voltage-controlled \[analog\] synthesizer including signal/voltage paths \(control voltage, gate, trigger\). Include the following components:** 
   * **1V/octave keyboard controller**
   * **VCO \(oscillator\)**
   * **EG \(envelop generator with ADSR\)**
   * **VCF \(filter\)**
   * **LFO \(modulation for tremolo and vibrato\)**
   * **VCA \(amplifier\)**
   * **mixer**
   * **output**
8. Describe the difference between subtractive and additive synthesis.
9. What is proper gain staging \(or proper gain structure\) for live sound? \(talk about the steps you would take to find the proper level for each part of the system — from mic to speaker\)
   * What does it mean to attenuate a signal? What word is used to describe the opposite of attenuating a signal?
   * Explain what a preamp does. What is the name of the knob used to control this? Define clipping \(or distortion\). Create a drawing that illustrates how a signal is distorted by clipping.
   * **What is feedback and what are some ways to avoid/lesson it?** 
   * Define pan.
   * Define EQ.
10. What are some differences between condenser and dynamic microphones?
    * What does a microphone’s polar pattern tell you about how it functions? List and draw a few polar patterns.
