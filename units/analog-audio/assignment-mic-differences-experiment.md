# Assignment \(mic differences experiment\)

Learning Outcome = understand the differences between dynamic and condenser mics.

### Setup

1. setup a Shure SM57 \(dynamic\) and a Rode M5 \(small diaphragm condenser\) so that both diaphragms are very close to each other facing the same direction
2. when you record:
   * record both microphones simultaneously with the preamps for each mic set such that the amplitude of both waveforms recorded look very similar \(advanced = target averaging around -18db if you can\)
   * try to make the waveforms of every recording look similar in amplitude \(vertically, similar width\) no matter the distance
   * take note of the following for your [response](https://benjohansen.gitbook.io/musictech/units/analog-audio/assignment-mic-differences-experiment#response):
     * what you have to do with the preamp when you move the mics further from the source
     * what happens with background noise with each mic
     * the microphone's self-noise
     * the usefulness of the "pop filter / windscreen"
     * quality of tone of each mic \(_frequency response_,\)
3. the content of your recordings should be:
   * music from an acoustic instrument or voice
   * and a single clap \(if you can, zoom in on the clap of each recording to see how the waveforms of each mic differ = showing their differences in _transient response_\)

### Recording

1. your **first recording** should be with the microphones positioned **2-6 inches** from the instrument
2. your **second recording** should be with the microphones positioned **4 feet** from the instrument
3. your **third recording** should be with the microphones **10 feet** from the instrument

### Response

1. [email me](https://www.baylor.edu/music/index.php?id=951763) your findings!: in a short essay \(paragraph\) describe what you discovered especially noting how dynamic and condenser mics differ; include anything and everything you learned from this experiment
