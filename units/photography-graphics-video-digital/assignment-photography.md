# Assignment \(photography\)

### Choose **ONE** of the two options:

1. **Use Adobe Photoshop** if your computer can handle it. It is totally **FREE** for students until May 31, 2020 by signing in using your Baylor ID/password.
   * Navigate to [https://creativecloud.adobe.com/ \(Links to an external site.\)](https://creativecloud.adobe.com/)
   * "Sign In" using your Baylor Email \(do **NOT** login using Facebook, Google, or Apple\) ... you will be redirected to the DUO login you are used to using.
   * I'm not completely sure how this works on your end yet ... but I think you have to download the [Adobe CC Desktop App \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/desktop-app.html), then install Photoshop ... it should be pretty straightforward.
   * Complete the following tutorials:
     * [https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/photo-retouching-basics.html \(Links to an external site.\)](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/photo-retouching-basics.html)
     * [https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/image-resizing-basics.html \(Links to an external site.\)](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/image-resizing-basics.html)[ \(Links to an external site.\)](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/image-resizing-basics.html)
     * [https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/ps-layers-basics.html \(Links to an external site.\)](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/ps-layers-basics.html)[ \(Links to an external site.\)](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/ps-layers-basics.html)

       * After this tutorial, do something similar on your own \(like the above\). Working with layers is a very practical skill to develop. Use your phone camera \(or better camera if you have one\) to take at least 3 different photos of something \(big picture photo and detail photos\). Then create a collage-like document similar to what you did in the tutorial, but with your own photos. Go to File &gt; Export &gt; Export As ... and save as a JPEG \(by choosing the format in the top right\). Finally, upload the JPEG to this assignment for me and others to see and "peer" review.
2. **Use Gimp**, an open source \(free\) alternative to Photoshop. It is honestly not as good as Photoshop because it is a bit more difficult to use and they didn't have all the money Adobe has to improve it through research and development ... but it is the best free option!
   * Download and install [Gimp \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.gimp.org/).
   * Complete the following tutorials:
     * Layers in Gimp = [https://bit.ly/2U9IFYH \(Links to an external site.\)](https://bit.ly/2U9IFYH)
       * [ \(Links to an external site.\)](https://bit.ly/2U9IFYH)two very useful tools \(make sure you select the layer you want to work with first\):
         * ![Screen Shot 2020-03-22 at 11.21.46 AM.png](https://baylor.instructure.com/courses/115065/files/5243451/preview) scale tool \(click "Readjust" in the popup if the resize boxes are off the screen\)
         * ![Screen Shot 2020-03-22 at 11.21.57 AM.png](https://baylor.instructure.com/courses/115065/files/5243452/preview) move tool
       * After this tutorial, do something similar to the last Photoshop tutorial above that produces a layered image like the man working with cloth. Working with layers is a very practical skill to develop. Use your phone camera \(or better camera if you have one\) to take at least 3 different photos of something \(big picture photo and detail photos\). Then create a collage-like document similar to what you did in the tutorial, but with your own photos. Go to File &gt; Export As ... and save as a JPEG \(by choosing the format in the bottom left "Select File Type"\). Finally, upload the JPEG to this assignment for me and others to see and "peer" review.
