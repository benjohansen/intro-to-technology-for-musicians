# Assignment \(music video\)

**Create a multi- or spit- screen music video \(one piece of music seamless throughout\) using the good gear you are borrowing from this class, a video camera \(your phone will do\), and DaVinci Resolve. It must be at least 1min in length. You may work in groups to audio/video record \(to create** [**something like this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eXT60rbBVk)**\), but each person must do all the editing of the files on their own computer in Resolve individually \(and you must adhere to social distancing ... I assume you will be doing recordings individually in different locations if you work in groups\). Note: there is no pressure to work in groups, you can create a video with** [**found sounds or homemade instruments**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1Ob1zhKCuk)**.**

**Turn in your assignment by uploading it to Youtube or Vimeo \(it can be unlisted\) and** [**Email me**](https://www.baylor.edu/music/index.php?id=951763) **the URL of your video.**
