# Assignment \(music video\)

**Create a multi- or spit- screen music video using DaVinci Resolve \(one piece of music seamless throughout\). It must be at least 1min in length. You may work in groups to audio/video record \(to create something like this \(Links to an external site.\)\), but each person must do all the editing of the files on their own computer in Resolve individually \(and you must adhere to social distancing ... I assume you will be doing recordings individually in different locations if you work in groups\). Note: there is no pressure to work in groups, you can create a video with found sounds or homemade instruments \(Links to an external site.\).**
