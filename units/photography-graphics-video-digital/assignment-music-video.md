# Assignment \(music video\)

**Create a multi- or spit- screen music video using DaVinci Resolve \(one piece of music seamless throughout\). It must be at least 1min in length. You may work in groups to audio/video record \(to create** [**something like this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eXT60rbBVk)**\), but each person must do all the editing of the files on their own computer in Resolve individually \(and you must adhere to social distancing ... I assume you will be doing recordings individually in different locations if you work in groups\). Note: there is no pressure to work in groups, you can create a video with** [**found sounds or homemade instruments**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1Ob1zhKCuk)**.**

First, watch the following introductions, examples, and tutorials:

2. [Example of Split Screen](https://bit.ly/3464uvT)
   * tripod required \(or you must secure the camera so it doesn't move \*at all\* when stopping and starting recording\)
   * use the “crop” video effect in Resolve
   * [tutorial for split screen](https://bit.ly/2JqcY7q)
3. [Example of MultiScreen](https://bit.ly/3dCqEdi)
   * use the “crop” and “motion” \(position, scale\)
   * [tutorial for muliscreen](https://bit.ly/2QVX0pJ)
