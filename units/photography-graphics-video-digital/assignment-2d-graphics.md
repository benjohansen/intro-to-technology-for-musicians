# Assignment \(2d graphics\)

### Choose **ONE** of the two options:

1. **Use Adobe Illustrator** if your computer can handle it. It is totally **FREE** for students until May 31, 2020 by signing in using your Baylor ID/password.
   * Navigate to [https://creativecloud.adobe.com/ \(Links to an external site.\)](https://creativecloud.adobe.com/)
   * "Sign In" using your Baylor Email \(do **NOT** login using Facebook, Google, or Apple\) ... you will be redirected to the DUO login you are used to using.
   * I'm not completely sure how this works on your end yet ... but I think you have to download the [Adobe CC Desktop App \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/desktop-app.html), then install Illustrator ... it should be pretty straightforward.
   * Complete [**this tutorial \(Links to an external site.\)**](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/draw-buildings.html) \(it is a great way to get to know Illustrator!\)
     * Choose File &gt; Save As. Select Adobe PDF and click Save.
     * upload the PDF to this assignment for me and others to see and "peer" review.
2. **Use Gravit** to work in the browser ... this is a great free alternative to Adobe Illustrator.
   * Navigate to [https://designer.gravit.io/ \(Links to an external site.\)](https://designer.gravit.io/)
   * log in with your Facebook or Google account and continue with free version \(you'll have to "x" out of the popup trying to get you to upgrade to a paid plan.
   * Complete [**this tutorial \(Links to an external site.\)**](https://bit.ly/3do4VWg) then:
     * \(within Gravit\) go to File &gt; Export &gt; PDF Document \(.pdf\) &gt; 72dpi
     * upload the PDF to this assignment for me and others to see and "peer" review.
