# Audition/Screening Video \(1 camera\)

**General tips:**

* üëè visually clap \(slate\) three times to assist in later synching audio and video
* use a tripod \(holding the camera with your hand is too shaky\)
* use only optical zoom \(don‚Äôt use digital zoom\)
* never stop recording on the camera or external audio recorder so you just have to sync the two once

**Camera settings:**

* use a separate audio recorder from the camera \(cameras have bad microphones\)
  * uncompressed \(AIFF, WAV\) 48kHz sample rate for audio
* [frame rate](https://www.diyphotography.net/learn-choose-best-frame-rate-videos-just-10-minutes/) = 24fps gives the ‚Äúfilm‚Äù look; higher frame rates will look more like a news show 
* MP4 and MOV are easy to work with \(AVCHD can produce higher quality\)
* custom white balance or use a preset \(such as ‚Äútungsten‚Äù\)
