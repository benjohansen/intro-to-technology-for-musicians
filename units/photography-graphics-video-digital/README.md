# 7. Photography/Graphics & Video \(digital\)

1. Video monitors \(computer screens\) are dimensioned in **pixels** and printers print on paper that is dimensioned in **inches**. That is why the **dpi \(dots per inch\)** specification of an image means nothing to a web browser displaying an image, but it determines the resolution and size that an image will print.
   * [This site](https://www.scantips.com/lights/pixels.html%C2%A0) goes pretty deep and is very "techy" ... but it will greatly help you understand what is going on with digital images. At very least, you should read a little of it. If it interests you, read it more methodically.
2. **How is a pixel in a digital photo just like the bit depth of a single sample in a digital audio file**
3. Discuss why optical zoom is better than digital zoom.
4. **What is the difference between raster and vector?**

**My hope is that you will be the awesome teachers that video record concerts with 3 or more cameras plus a set of stereo microphones \(one camera in the back of the hall is boring!\). I have provided you with tips for shooting with 3 cameras and tips to tell parents you may ask to run cameras \(hold a shot for 10sec., etc.\). Read through these tips and gain an understanding for the use of 3 cameras \(especially since we cannot try this out in person\), then complete the assignment using demo files I've provided.**

### General tips

* üëè visually clap \(slate\) three times to assist in later synching audio and video
* get performers‚Äô permission and you may need a synchronization license
* use tripods \(holding the camera with your hand is too shaky\)
* use only optical zoom \(don‚Äôt use digital zoom\); buy camera with 20x or more optical zoom
* never stop recording on any of the cameras so aligning camera footage is easy
* ‚è±hold a shot for at least 10 seconds
* don‚Äôt shoot like spraying a garden hose = zoom/pan only between shots

### Editing Software Suggestions

* ‚Äã[DaVinci Resolve \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) by BlackMagicDesign \(free \) - [training for DaVinci Resolve \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/training)‚Äã
* [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/) \(open source\) for "slow computers"
* Adobe Premiere \($$\) - [video tutorials for Adobe Premiere \(Links to an external site.\)](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/premiere-pro/tutorials.html)‚Äã

### Recording the Concert

**Camera settings**

* use a separate audio recorder from the camera \(cameras have bad microphones\)
  * uncompressed \(AIFF, WAV\) 48kHz sample rate for audio
* ‚Äã[frame rate \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.diyphotography.net/learn-choose-best-frame-rate-videos-just-10-minutes/) = 24fps gives the ‚Äúfilm‚Äù look \(high frame rates can create smooth slow motion\)
* MP4 and MOV are easy to work with \(AVCHD can produce higher quality\)
* white balance = set the same for all cameras \(custom white balance is best\)
  * easiest = use preset \(such as ‚Äútungsten‚Äù\)
* ‚Äã[develop understanding of \(Links to an external site.\)](https://bit.ly/2QUMq26): [shutter speed \(Links to an external site.\)](https://bit.ly/2WR9Itu) vs. [frame rate \(Links to an external site.\)](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/frame-rate-vs-shutter-speed-setting-the-record-str), [ISO \(‚Äúgain‚Äù\) \(Links to an external site.\)](https://bit.ly/3auzxns), and [aperture \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jaredpolin/sets/72157626710263148/) \([f-stop \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vox/5367295420/)\)

* Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket: use more than one camera!

**Typical 3 camera setup:**

* Cam1 = ‚ÄúSafety‚Äù = fixed, wide angle camera that gets everything \(turn off autofocus\)
* Cam2 = manned camera hunting for medium & close up shots of performer\(s\)
* Cam3 = manned camera hunting for medium & close up shots of performer\(s\) AND b-roll footage = timeless reaction shots \(of the audience, for example\)

**Composition**

* use rule of thirds \(turn on grid\)
  * use lead space = space in front of where subject is facing
* avoid placing your frame edge on one of the body‚Äôs joints
* avoid too much headroom \(or person looks to be sinking\)
* avoid too little headroom \(or focus will be on the person‚Äôs chin and neck\)
* use a variety of [Shot types \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-camera-shots/) \(hold a shot for at least 10 seconds\)
  * extreme long shot \(XLS\) = establishing shot - context for shots to follow
  * long shot \(LS\) = person from head to feet
  * medium shot \(MS\) = person from about waist up
  * closeup shot \(CU\) = person‚Äôs neck and head
  * extreme closeup shot \(XCU\) = one detail of a person
  * cut in = closeup shot of an object \(such as the face of a watch or an instrument key\)
* more shot types = [https://www.instagram.com/p/B6DZWA9ChDB/?igshid=pbgpx0ctas8h](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6DZWA9ChDB/?igshid=pbgpx0ctas8h)
