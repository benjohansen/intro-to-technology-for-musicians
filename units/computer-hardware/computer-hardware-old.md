## The following is "15 Computer Topics" from [ComputerHope.com](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001262.htm)

1. **Transistors** - The computer contains millions of [transistors](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/transist.htm), which are used to create machine language using [logic gates](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/l/logicgat.htm) that turn on and off the [circuits](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/circuit.htm).
2. **Machine language** - All computers and electronic devices communicate in [binary](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/binary.htm), which is a series of 0's and 1's or Off and On electrical signals. All software written on your computer is created in a [high-level programming language](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/highll.htm) that humans can understand. When complete, the program is [compiled](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/compile.htm) into a low-level [machine language](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/machlang.htm) that computers understand.
3. **ASCII codes** - Each binary 0 or 1 is considered a [bit](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/bit.htm) and each number, letter, or other [character](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/charact.htm) is made up of eight bits \(one [byte](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/byte.htm)\). A common method for storing and editing text is done with [ASCII codes](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/ascii.htm), which is one byte of binary. For example, the lowercase letter "a" has an ASCII code [decimal](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/decimal.htm) value of 97, which is 01100001 in binary.
4. **Motherboard** - The [Motherboard](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/mothboar.htm) is the largest [circuit board](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pcb.htm) in the computer that holds and connects everything together. Without the motherboard, components like your processor and memory could not communicate with each other.
5. **Computer memory** - Not to be confused with disk storage, the computer [memory](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/memory.htm) \([RAM](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/ram.htm)\) is [volatile memory](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/volamemo.htm) and is used to store currently running applications. When the computer is turned off, all data in the memory is lost.
6. **Computer disk storage** - A [non-volatile](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/nonvolat.htm) type of memory, disk storage like a [hard drive](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/harddriv.htm) is what stores your information even when the computer is turned off. All your files, documents, songs, photos, etc. are stored in a [storage device](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/stordevi.htm).
7. **ROM** - Another type of memory, read-only memory \([ROM](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/rom.htm)\) is a memory chip that has data which can only be read. Most computers today have a programmable read-only memory \([PROM](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/progrrom.htm)\), which is still read-only, but can be re-programmed if needed through a [firmware](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/firmware.htm) update.
8. **Memory capacity** - All memory and storage has a total capacity that is written using abbreviations such as [KB](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/k/kilobyte.htm), [MB](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/megabyte.htm), [GB](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/gigabyte.htm), and [TB](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/terabyte.htm). See the [full overview of all computer capacities](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/chspace.htm) for a complete understanding of all values.
9. **Processor** - The Central Processing Unit \([CPU](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/cpu.htm)\) is the component responsible for processing all instructions from software and hardware.
10. **Software and Hardware** - [Software](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/software.htm) is instructions and code installed into the computer, like the [Internet browser](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/browser.htm) you're using to view this page. [Hardware](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/hardware.htm) is a physical device you can touch, like the [monitor](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/monitor.htm)you're using to display this page. See the [differences between computer hardware and software](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000039.htm) for more information.
11. **Input/Output** - Humans use [input devices](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/inputdev.htm), such as a [keyboard](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/k/keyboard.htm), to interact with a computer. The computer processes that data, then sends the modified or new information to an [output device](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/outputde.htm), such as a [monitor](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/monitor.htm). The [printer](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/printer.htm) is another output device, which can produce a [hard copy](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/hardcopy.htm) of documents and pictures stored on the computer.
12. **Expansion cards** - An [expansion card](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/expacard.htm) is a card that can be added to the computer to give it additional capabilities. A [video card](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/video-card.htm), [modem](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/modem.htm), [network card](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/nic.htm), and [sound card](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/souncard.htm) are all examples of expansion cards. However, many computers may also have [on-board](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/onboard.htm) devices, such as a sound card and network card that are built onto the motherboard. For a [laptop](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/l/laptop.htm) computer, additional cards are added into the [PC Card](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pccard.htm) slot.
13. **Programming** - All software running on a computer was created using a [programming language](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/programming-language.htm) by a [computer programmer](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/progmmer.htm).
14. **Operating system** - Every computer must have an [operating system](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/os.htm)for software to communicate with the hardware. For example, most IBM compatible computers run the [Microsoft Windows](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/windows.htm) operating system and have the option to run alternative operating systems, such as a [Linux](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/l/linux.htm) variant. Apple computers only run [macOS](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/macos.htm).
15. **Network** - Computers communicate with other computers over a network using a [network interface card \(NIC\)](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/nic.htm) or [Wi-Fi](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/wifi.htm) that connects to a [router](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/router.htm). There are two primary types of networks: a [local area network \(LAN\)](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/l/lan.htm) and a [wide area network \(WAN\)](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/wan.htm). The [Internet](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/internet.htm) is also considered a network, which uses the [TCP/IP](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tcpip.htm) [protocol](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/protocol.htm).
