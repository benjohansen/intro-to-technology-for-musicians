# 1. Computer Hardware

1. What makes a computer a computer? \(4 things\)
   * [How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-) \(27min of short videos in a playlist\)
   * [Fetch \[Decode\] Execute Cycle: What's Your Computer Actually Doing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5JC9Ve1sfI) \(9min video\)
   * "15 Computer Topics" from [ComputerHope.com](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001262.htm)
2. What form must data be in for a computer to be able to store and process it?
   * [Understanding Binary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc-9uASeU7I) \(video\)
     * denary = base 10 \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\)
     * binary = base 2 \(0, 1\)
   * Is a paper piano roll an analog or digital medium of storage?
   * List 2 different mediums on which media and/or information has been stored in analog format and 2 different mediums on which binary \(digital\) data has been stored.
3. What is a transistor, what did it replace, and why is it the most important invention of the 20th Century?
   * think of a transistor as a switch that opens and closes an electrical gate ... with a very small amount of electricity, a transistor can allow or stop large amounts of electricity from going through it

4. Draw a block diagram that shows how the parts of a computer connect. Include labels for: CPU, Control Unit, Arithmetic Logic Unit, RAM \(main memory\), storage \(aux storage\), input, and output.

7. What is the purpose of RAM?
8. How many cycles \(steps of instructions\) per second can a \*quad core\* 2.4 GHz processor perform? How many cycles per second can a 333 MHz processor perform?

9. What are sensors? \(convert what into what?\)
   * keyboard = on/off switches
   * mouse = CMOS sensor \(like digital camera\)
   * What is the “Internet of Things” \(IoT\)?
