# Assignment \(notation\)

This is a very open ended assignment with very few parameters. 

* The key learning outcomes are:
  * gain guided experience properly using MuseScore most efficiently/effectively - an application you _**will**_ use in the future even if you own Dorico, Sibelius, or Finale
  * gain guided experience properly using Dorico most efficiently/effectively - in my opinion the best professional notation software; depending on your future needs, you may decide it is worth the money to purchase Dorico rather than use MuseScore

Devote as much time for this project as you want for the sake of your future. There is not minimum or maximum this semester.

**Ideally** = input a score for your applied or ensemble professor that they really need input into a notation software \(input a part from the score when a part is missing, make a hand written score legible, transpose a piano part for a vocal score that is too low or too high, transcribe something written for a different instrument, etc.\). Input the score into into **both** MuseScore and Dorico to look as much like the score as possible ...  fix that which the publisher's printed incorrectly. If you cannot find anything any professor needs input, let me know and I'll ask around. If we can still not find a need, you can input something from your solo rep.

* **Compress the following four files into a zip file and** [**email me**](https://www.baylor.edu/music/index.php?id=951763) **the zip file:**
  1. MuseScore file of the score \(it will be a file with a `.mscz` file extension\)
  2. MuseScore generated PDF of the score \(it will be a file with a `.pdf` file extension\)
  3. Dorico file of the score \(it will be a file with a `.dorico` file extension\)
  4. Dorico generated PDF of the score \(it will be a file with a `.pdf` file extension\)

## MuseScore

1. Download and install MuseScore = [https://musescore.org/en](https://musescore.org/en)
2. I've compiled some helpful hints on the page linked below for your reference \(some things I tend to forget and need often\).

## Dorico

1. [Download and install Dorico Trial](https://new.steinberg.net/dorico/trial/) \(you'll have 30 days to use it\)
   * choose Dorico Pro if you have a fairly high powered computer \(especially if you had no issues using Resolve\)
   * choose Dorico Elements if you know your computer is not particularly high performance
2. Watch How To videos. I suggest you at very least watch all the "setup mode" and "write mode" videos.
