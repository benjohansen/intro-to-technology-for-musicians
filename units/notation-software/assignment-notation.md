# Assignment \(notation\)



To begin with, you need to watch and follow along with some tutorials before you begin your project \(or, once again, you'll be very frustrated trying to figure stuff out on your own ... I want you to have an enjoyable experience!\). I really want you to use Dorico if at all possible. If you run into major issues getting Dorico to work on your computer, you may use MuseScore for this project. It is worth your time to learn MuseScore because it can always be a free backup for you in your future career. I think everyone should know how to use MuseScore ... Dorico is just a much better program and you'll see that MuseScore is very limiting once you see all that Dorico can do.

1. [Download and install the full Dorico Pro Trial \(Links to an external site.\)](https://new.steinberg.net/dorico/trial/) \(you'll have 30 days to use it\)
2. Watch How To videos. I suggest you at very least watch all the "setup mode" and "write mode" videos.

3. [ \(Links to an external site.\)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoyaeouPUsdt6H-SQgBH3_2-_qC-YxGHA)I've compiled [**some helpful tips here \(Links to an external site.\)**](https://benjohansen.gitbook.io/musictech/unit-2-music/notation-software/dorico) for your reference \(some things I tend to forget and need often\).
4. **The assignment:**
   * This is a very open ended assignment with very few parameters. The key learning outcomes are for you to gain experience using Dorico and see how it can save you time and assist with you creating professional looking scores.
   * Choose any score and input the notation in Dorico to look as much like the score as possible ... even fix things if some of the publisher's markings were incorrect. You may also choose to input a score that is hard to read. I've had many students input scores for their applied teacher \(input a missing part from the score, make things legible from a hand written score, etc.\) ... so you may want to contact your applied teacher if you just want something to work on that would help them out.
   * Devote as much time for this project as you want for the sake of your future. There is not minimum or maximum, but you must use Dorico Pro.
   * Let me know if you have questions.
   * Upload **BOTH** the Dorico file of the score and a Dorico generated PDF \(you may have to put both in a folder and compress them into a zip file if Canvas doesn't like you uploading a Dorico file\).
