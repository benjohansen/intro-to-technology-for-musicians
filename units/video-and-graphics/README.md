# 8. Video & Graphics

1. Bold words in the following two bullets will be blanks for you to fill in on a test.
   * Video monitors \(computer screens\) are dimensioned in **pixels** and printers print on paper that is dimensioned in **inches**. That is why the **dpi \(dots per inch\)** specification of an image means nothing to a web browser displaying an image, but it determines the resolution and size that an image will print.
     * [This site](https://www.scantips.com/lights/pixels.html%C2%A0) goes pretty deep and is very "techy" ... but it will greatly help you understand what is going on with digital images. At very least, you should read a little of it. If it interests you, read it more methodically.
2. **How is a pixel in a digital photo just like the bit depth of a single sample in a digital audio file**
3. Discuss why optical zoom is better than digital zoom.
4. **What is the difference between raster and vector?**
