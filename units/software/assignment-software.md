# Assignment \(software\)

1. Hour of Code:
   * Complete 1-4 \(hello, shapes, color, interact\) = [https://hello.processing.org/](https://hello.processing.org/) \(about 30min\)
   * work on the following introduction to coding for about 30min = [https://learnprogramming.online/app](https://learnprogramming.online/app)
2. Record one "note" of your instrument \[again with any device\] working very hard to record absolutely no background noise and upload it to your freesound.org account. Finding a way to not record the AC, people talking, traffic noise, etc. is very difficult. See what you can do to control \*not\* recording background noises. Mic placement and recording location \(walk in closets can be great\) are two of the parameters you can control the most.
