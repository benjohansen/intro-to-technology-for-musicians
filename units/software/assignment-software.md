# Assignment \(software\)

1. **Hour of Code**:
   * Complete 1-4 \(hello, shapes, color, interact\) = [https://hello.processing.org/](https://hello.processing.org/) \(about 30min\)
   * work on the following introduction to coding for about 30min = [https://learnprogramming.online/app.html](https://learnprogramming.online/app.html)
2. \[required\] **Challenge** = record one "note" of your instrument \[again with any device\] working very hard to record absolutely no background noise and upload it to your freesound.org account.
   * just to clarify = there is no need to edit the audio for this assignment; I want you to try to record the original audio in a way \(physically\) that picks up as little background noise as possible.
