# Assignment \(stereo recording\)

Reference the [Introduction to Computer Music site](https://cmtext.indiana.edu/studio/chapter2_mics5.php) to learn specifics about XY and ORTF microphone setups.

1. Create another page on your Github site dedicated just to this project and include the following:
   * Photo of the XY setup cropped ![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-09-28-at-11.45.49-am.png) to square and resized to 500x500pixels ... you may use the super easy [Pixlr X or E editors](https://pixlr.com/)
   * **\*link\*** to Box direct download \(_not_ embed\) of .WAV file of you recording stereo-worthy musical content using the XY setup with a sample rate of 48k and bit depth of 24bit
     * make sure you have edited the recording so it begins right away and averages -14 LUF integrated and -1dB True Peak ... you may edit the recording further if you would like to by adding EQ, reverb, etc., but that is not required.
   * Photo of the ORTF setup cropped ![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-09-28-at-11.45.49-am.png) to square and resized to 500x500pixels ... you may use the super easy [Pixlr X or E editors](https://pixlr.com/) \(include a ruler or tape measure in the photo showing 17cm distance between diaphragms and a protractor showing 110Â° angle of the microphones\) 
   * **\*link\*** to Box direct download \(_not_ embed\) of .WAV file of you recording stereo-worthy musical content using the ORTF setup with a sample rate of 48k and bit depth of 24bit
     * make sure you have edited the recording so it begins right away and averages -14 LUF integrated and -1dB True Peak ... you may edit the recording further if you would like to by adding EQ, reverb, etc., but that is not required.
