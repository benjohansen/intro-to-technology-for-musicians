# 5. Digital Audio

**Analog Sound Reinforcement:**

1. What is proper gain staging \(or proper gain structure\) for live sound? \(talk about the steps you would take to find the proper level for each part of the system — from mic to speaker\)
2. What does it mean to attenuate a signal? What word is used to describe the opposite of attenuating a signal?
3. Explain what a preamp does. What is the name of the knob used to control this?
4. Define clipping \(or distortion\). Create a drawing that illustrates how a signal is distorted by clipping.
5. Define pan.
6. Define EQ.
7. What does a microphone’s polar pattern tell you about how it functions? List and draw a few polar patterns.
8. **What is feedback and what are some ways to avoid/lesson it?** 
9. What type of microphone is a Shure SM58? What is its polar pattern? Does it need phantom power \(48V\)?
10. What type of microphone is a Neumann U87? What size is it’s diaphragm? What polar patterns are available? Does it need phantom power \(48V\)?
11. How would you describe the sound difference between the Shure SM58 and the Neumann U87? \(use the term “transient response” in your answer\)

    **Digital Audio:**

12. **Explain analog-to-digital conversion \(ADC\) and digital-to-analog conversion \(DAC\) using the following terms in your answer: sample rate, bit depth, voltage, samples, audio interface, and speakers.**
13. Write the following out with blanks filled in:
    * An analog signal is a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ signal; analog signal values are known for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
    * A digital signal is a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ signal; digital signals are only known at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
14. State the Nyquist Sample Theorem \(include the following term in your answer: Nyquist frequency\).
15. During analog-to-digital conversion, quantization is necessary in a specific stage of the conversion. Describe when/why quantization is used in ADC \*and\* how quantization is used with MIDI data. \(hint: what is usually quantized in MIDI?\)
16. Define bit rate.
17. Discuss the difference between a MIDI file and a WAV file. What type of information is stored in each file?
18. Define and discuss when you use lossless audio files \(and give examples of lossless file types\) and when you would use lossy audio files \(and give examples of lossy file types\).

    **Audio Recording/Mixing:**

19. How do the acoustics and noise present in the recording space effect mic placement when recording? \(For instance: Where would you place the mic if you didn’t like the space and didn’t want the characteristics of the space to be apparent in the recording?\)
20. **Explain proper gain structure \(or staging\) in the recording process. What two levels are you looking for on the level meter when you are recording?**  
21. Define multitrack recording.

    \*\*\*\*

    **Audio Editing:**

22. Explain proper gain staging in the mixing processes. What plugin should you add to every track in the very beginning of the mixing process \[in order to keep \*all\* faders initially at 0db … or -6dB if you choose that technique\]?
23. What is the purpose of automation in a DAW? Provide some examples of parameters you might automate.
24. How does normalization work?
25. How does a compressor work? \(be sure to include the terms “threshold” and “compression ratio”\).
