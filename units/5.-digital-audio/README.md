# 5. Digital Audio

**Digital Audio:**

1. **Explain analog-to-digital conversion \(ADC\) and digital-to-analog conversion \(DAC\) using the following terms in your answer: sample rate, bit depth, voltage, samples, audio interface, and speakers.**
   * [How Digital Audio Works](https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/tutorials/02_mspdigitalaudio#Digital_representation_of_sound) \(MSP documentation by Cycling'74\)
   * What is a sample? = [https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/sample/](https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/sample/)
2. Bold words in the following two bullets will be blanks for you to fill in on a test.
   * An analog signal is a **continuous** signal; analog signal values are known for **all moments in time.**
   * A digital signal is a **discrete** signal; digital signals are only known at **certain specific times.**
3. State the Nyquist Sample Theorem \(include the following term in your answer: Nyquist frequency\).
4. During analog-to-digital conversion, quantization is necessary in a specific stage of the conversion. Describe when/why quantization is used in ADC \*and\* how quantization is used with MIDI data. \(hint: what is usually quantized in MIDI?\)
5. Define bit rate.
6. Discuss the difference between a MIDI file and a WAV file. What type of information is stored in each file?
7. Define and discuss when you use lossless audio files \(and give examples of lossless file types\) and when you would use lossy audio files \(and give examples of lossy file types\).

**Audio Recording/Mixing:**

1. How do the acoustics and noise present in the recording space effect mic placement when recording? \(For instance: Where would you place the mic if you didn’t like the space and didn’t want the characteristics of the space to be apparent in the recording?\)
2. **Explain proper gain structure \(or staging\) in the recording process. What two levels are you looking for on the level meter when you are recording?**  
3. Define multitrack recording.

   \*\*\*\*

   **Audio Editing:**

4. Explain proper gain staging in the mixing processes. What plugin should you add to every track in the very beginning of the mixing process \[in order to keep \*all\* faders initially at 0db … or -6dB if you choose that technique\]?
5. What is the purpose of automation in a DAW? Provide some examples of parameters you might automate.
6. How does normalization work?
7. How does a compressor work? \(be sure to include the terms “threshold” and “compression ratio”\).
