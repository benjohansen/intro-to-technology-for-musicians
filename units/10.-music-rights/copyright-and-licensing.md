# Copyright & Licensing

This is simply an informal guide and does not in any way represent legal advise!

[National Association for Music Education has a wonderful resource on copyright and licensing.](https://nafme.org/my-classroom/copyright/)

## **Copyright**

* A simple definition of copyright is a “limited duration monopoly.”  For a period of time, copyright allows the creator to have exclusive rights to his or her works, and therefore it incentivizes creativity and promotes progress in the arts. 
  * U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8:

    > The Congress shall have power . . . \[Clause 8:\] To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;...
* Create something in one of the following protected categories and record \(fix\) it in a “tangible medium of expression” to own copyright:
  * literary works
  * musical works
  * dramatic works
  * pantomimes and choreographic works
  * pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works
  * motion pictures and other audiovisual works
  * sound recordings
  * architectural works
* sifting process for using others’ works:
  * Is it in the Public Domain? \(in U.S. = cut-off for [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain_in_the_United_States) moves forward every year; some later works are in the public domain too\)
  * Is the planned use covered by an exception? \(performance exceptions for teaching, concerts, and worship\)
  * Is the planned use covered by a Fair Use exception? \(complete a Fair Use Analysis\)
  * What type of permission or license will have to be acquired?

## **Licensing**

* Licensing is the mechanism by which to get written permission to use someone’s copyrighted music. There are different kinds of licenses to cover different kinds of uses, and there are a number of organizations that serve as the middleman in this process.
* A license is a type of contract that describes what you can do with a copyrighted work and how much you will pay for the privilege. It’s important to know that a contract supersedes the copyright law. So, if you have a license that allows you to do either more or less than you could normally do under the law, it’s the license that you should follow.
* Types of licenses you need depending on your project:
  * live performance = you'll need a **public performance license** from a Performing Rights Organizations \(PRO = ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, GMR\), they collect royalties on behalf of composers, songwriters, and music publishers when their works are performed publicly, then periodically pay everyone their fair share.
    * Note: most performances in schools are covered by the Concert Performance Exception, so PROs will not be involved in those \(unless you charge admission, etc.\)
  * audio recording = [**mechanical license**](https://www.easysonglicensing.com/pages/help/articles/music-licensing/what-is-a-mechanical-license.aspx) ****\(you need this from the composer,  publisher, or licensing agent like Harry Fox Agency to distribute recordings of someone else's musical composition ... [this resource explains it well](https://nafme.org/my-classroom/copyright/mechanical-licensing-you-what-you-need-to-know-before-recording-your-schools-performances/)\)
  * arranging = **permission to arrange or adapt license**

  * video project = [**synchronization license**](https://www.easysonglicensing.com/pages/help/articles/music-licensing/what-is-a-synchronization-license.aspx)\*\*\*\*
