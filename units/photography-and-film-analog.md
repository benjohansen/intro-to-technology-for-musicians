# 6. Photography & Film \(analog\)

1. What are the camera settings that give you control of exposure? What do each of them do?
   * Understanding how still photography works will greatly help you understand how video works. Begin by watching this 4min video about how exposure works = [Shutter speed, Aperture and ISO: What do these mean and how do cameras work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd9oNggNqjQ)
2. Describe distance-of-field \(use the term “aperture”\).
   * Use [this interactive website](http://www.canonoutsideofauto.ca/play/) to understand exposure and depth of field.
   * Use [this second interactive site ](http://www.andersenimages.com/tutorials/exposure-simulator/)to get more exposure and depth of field practice.
3. Discuss the differences between frame rate and shutter speed. What is the industry standard film frame rate?
4. What is the negative product of increasing Gain and/or ISO? What are other things you can do to brighten the image that don't involve increasing Gain and/or ISO?
