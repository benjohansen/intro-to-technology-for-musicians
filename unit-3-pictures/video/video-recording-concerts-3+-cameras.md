# Video Recording Concerts \(3+ Cameras\)

#### **General tips**

* üëè visually clap \(slate\) three times to assist in later synching audio and video
* get performers‚Äô permission and you may need a synchronization license
* use tripods \(holding the camera with your hand is too shaky\)
* use only optical zoom \(don‚Äôt use digital zoom\); buy camera with 20x or more optical zoom
* never stop recording on any of the cameras so aligning camera footage is easy
* ‚è±**hold a shot for at least 10 seconds**
* don‚Äôt shoot like spraying a garden hose = zoom/pan only _between_ shots

#### **Editing software Suggestions**

* Adobe Premiere \($$\) - [video tutorials for Adobe Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/premiere-pro/tutorials.html)
* DaVinci Resolve \(free - BlackMagicDesign\) - [training for DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/training)
* after editing, use MPEG-4 as your video container \(see what YouTube, etc. suggest\)
  * audio = AAC
  * video = H.264

## Recording the Concert

### **Camera settings**

* use a separate audio recorder from the camera \(cameras have bad microphones\)
  * uncompressed \(AIFF, WAV\) 48kHz sample rate for audio
* [frame rate](https://www.diyphotography.net/learn-choose-best-frame-rate-videos-just-10-minutes/) = 24fps gives the ‚Äúfilm‚Äù look \(high frame rates can create smooth slow motion\)
* MP4 and MOV are easy to work with \(AVCHD can produce higher quality\)
* white balance = set the same for all cameras \(custom white balance is best\)
  * easiest = use preset \(such as ‚Äútungsten‚Äù\)
* [develop understanding of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd9oNggNqjQ): [shutter speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGud8vGwp-Y) vs. [frame rate](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/frame-rate-vs-shutter-speed-setting-the-record-str), [ISO \(‚Äúgain‚Äù\)](https://youtu.be/WEApLA-YNko), and [aperture](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jaredpolin/sets/72157626710263148/) \([f-stop](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vox/5367295420/)\)

Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket: use more than one camera!

### **Typical 3 camera setup:**

* **Cam1** = ‚ÄúSafety‚Äù = fixed, wide angle camera that gets everything \(**turn off autofocus**\)
* **Cam2** = manned camera hunting for medium & close up shots of performer\(s\)
* **Cam3** = manned camera hunting for medium & close up shots of performer\(s\) **AND** b-roll footage = timeless reaction shots \(of the audience, for example\)

### **Composition**

* use rule of thirds \(turn on grid\)
  * use lead space = space in front of where subject is facing
* avoid placing your frame edge on one of the body‚Äôs joints
* avoid too much headroom \(or person looks to be sinking\)
* avoid too little headroom \(or focus will be on the person‚Äôs chin and neck\)
* use a variety of [**Shot types**](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/video/tips-and-solutions/filmmaking-101-camera-shot-types) \(hold a shot for at least 10 seconds\)
  * extreme long shot \(XLS\) = establishing shot - context for shots to follow
  * long shot \(LS\) = person from head to feet
  * medium shot \(MS\) = person from about waist up
  * closeup shot \(CU\) = person‚Äôs neck and head
  * extreme closeup shot \(XCU\) = one detail of a person
  * cut in = closeup shot of an object \(such as the face of a watch or an instrument key\)
