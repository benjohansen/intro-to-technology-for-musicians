1. Open Logic Pro and make it function as Logic rather than GarageBand
   * In the top left of Logic … go to **Logic Pro X** &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced Tools …
   * put a checkmark on “Show Advanced Tools”
   * click the “Enable All” button at the bottom
2. Go to File &gt; New … then add 1 Audio Track and click the “Create” button
3. Save \(somewhere you can find it, like the Desktop\) … and save often; Logic saves everything, including imported audio, in one convenient folder \(called a package\)
4. add the stem tracks
   * [Download the 13 tracks to mix here.](https://baylor.box.com/shared/static/vsv0r2qy3iteulvnp2us93hrsfn8obm5.zip)
   * Double click the ZIP file you downloaded to unzip it
   * Drag all the tracks into Logic \(measure 1, below the empty audio track\) and check next to “Create new tracks” \(you can now delete the empty audio track if you want\)

### Begin Mixing

1. **Institute proper Gain Staging** \(every mixing session should begin with this ... [here is a helpful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=8&v=UvclmTMmGv0) ... and [here is a helpful article](https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/gain-staging-your-daw-software)\)
   * add a gain plugin to every track
   * one by one, lower gain using the gain plugin until each track averages around -18dB and never goes beyond -6dB \(your ceiling should be -6dB \*not\* 0dB\)
   * Instituting proper gain staging first is the first step in making sure each tracks' input stays at a good level throughout the signal chain. The volume of a tracks' signal should be the same going in as it is going out of each plugin. Here is a basic signal chain for a DAW track:
     1. preamp gain knob \(usually a physical knob on the audio interface\)
     2. audio effects \(add gain plugin first\) including EQ
     3. fader
     4. pan
     5. lastly to master stereo track \(bus sends can be found before and after audio effects\)
2. [Use Automation](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH24489?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US) \(press “a” to toggle on/off\) … click on the lines to add points
3. Pan \(especially mono tracks\) - consider the dialogue between drums and psaltery … try    panning the drums left of center and the psaltery right of center
   * a circle indicates a track is mono \(recorded with one mic\)
   * two circles overlapped \(like a venn diagram\) indicates a track is stereo \(recorded with two microphones\)
4. EQ \([Logic Channel EQ help document](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH27553?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US)\)
5. Add compression \(due to the ability to choose a threshold and compression ratio, compression functions very differently than normalizing\)
6. Add reverb as a plugin where needed \(Space Designer presets are amazing!\) … add to brass
