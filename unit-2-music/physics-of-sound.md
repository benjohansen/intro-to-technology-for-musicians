* Hosken, _Introduction to Music Technology_ \(Routledge, 2011\):

> The air around and in your ears is made up of molecules of various types: oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and others that we probably don’t want to think about. Between the molecules in the air is … nothing. This means that the air molecules can be pushed together, or compressed, into a smaller space. A property of air known as elasticity causes the molecules that have been compressed together to spring apart again.
