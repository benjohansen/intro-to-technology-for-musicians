# Introduction to Technology for Musicians

## Description

This technology course, designed specifically for musicians, balances quantitative technology knowledge with practical technology experience. 

There are **no technological skill prerequisites** _and_ I do not assume you have any technology skills or knowledge. 

This course includes fundamentals of: computer science, sound synthesis, notation software, sound reinforcement, digital audio recording/mixing/editing, copyright/licensing, graphic design, photography, and videography with the means to empower musicians with digital and media literacy.

## Course Objective: E**mpower musicians with digital and media literacy.**

> Like every other facet of life, music too has been greatly affected by technology. Technology is an integral part of the way much music in today's world is created, performed, preserved, and consumed, and it can be an authentic aspect of the expression of individual musicianship. Performing musicians use instruments, both digital and otherwise, that have been enhanced through technology. Popular musicians in particular have taken advantage of digital technologies to utilize unique sounds and effects in their concerts. Performances are recorded using sophisticated software and hardware that enable the captured sound to be easily mixed and edited. Composers and arrangers use sequencing and notation software to create printed notation and compositions. Some of these applications have experienced a remarkable transformation; as they grow more and more powerful, they also become easier to use—for example, professional-sounding recordings can now be created in basement music studios.

## Learning Objectives

* **Record** a variety of visual and aural content \[digitally\]
* **Edit** a variety of digital content
* **Create** a variety of digital content
* **Collaborate** with others on digital projects
