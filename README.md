# Introduction to Technology for Musicians

## Instructor

[Dr. Ben Johansen](https://www.baylor.edu/music/johansen)

## Course Description

This technology course, designed specifically for musicians, balances quantitative technology knowledge with practical technology experience. 

There are **no technological skill prerequisites** _and_ I do not assume you have any technology skills or knowledge. 

This course includes fundamentals of: computer science, sound synthesis, notation software, sound reinforcement, digital audio recording/mixing/editing, copyright/licensing, graphic design, photography, and videography with the means to empower musicians with digital and media literacy.

## **Media Literacy**

Defined by the [Center for Media Literacy \(CML\)](http://www.medialit.org/media-literacy-definition-and-more%20) as:

The following quotes are from Bauer, William I. "A Conceptual Framework for Technology-Assisted Music Learning." In Music Learning Today: Digital Pedagogy for Creating, Performing, and Responding to Music. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014. Oxford Scholarship Online, 2014. doi: [10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199890590.003.0001](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199890590.001.0001). Chapter 1, pg. 6.

> Like every other facet of life, music too has been greatly affected by technology. Technology is an integral part of the way much music in today's world is created, performed, preserved, and consumed, and it can be an authentic aspect of the expression of individual musicianship. Performing musicians use instruments, both digital and otherwise, that have been enhanced through technology. Popular musicians in particular have taken advantage of digital technologies to utilize unique sounds and effects in their concerts. Performances are recorded using sophisticated software and hardware that enable the captured sound to be easily mixed and edited. Composers and arrangers use sequencing and notation software to create printed notation and compositions. Some of these applications have experienced a remarkable transformation; as they grow more and more powerful, they also become easier to use—for example, professional-sounding recordings can now be created in basement music studios.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to confidently, judiciously, and skillfully use technology hardware and software to:

* **Record** a variety of visual and aural content \[digitally\]
* **Edit** a variety of digital content
* **Create** a variety of digital content
* **Collaborate** with others on digital projects
* **Share** a variety of digital content
* **Teach** musical skills and concepts

## Attendance

The following is straight from the School of Music Undergraduate Handbook:

> School of Music policy requires that to earn credit in a course a student must be officially enrolled by the end of the second full week of the semester and attend at least 75% of all class meetings. Faculty members may establish additional attendance requirements as outlined in course syllabi. Any student who is not present for at least 75% of the scheduled class sessions for any course will automatically receive a grade of “F” in the course. Any University-related activity necessitating an absence from class **will count** as an absence when determining whether a student has attended the required 75% of class meetings.

* Missing 20min of any portion of a class meeting will result in a 1/2 absence.
* Attendance is not calculated in your grade \(but you must attend at least 75% of class meetings to pass the course; those that miss more than 6 of the 27 classes fail the course\).

## Grading

Your final grade will be calculated out of the following. Notice half your grade is based on technology experiences \(creative technology projects\) and half your grade is based on quantitative measures \(final exam\).

* 50% Creative Technology Projects
* 50% Cumulative Final Exam \(provided at the end of this syllabus\)

### Grade Scale:

* A  = 90-100
* B+ = 87-89
* B  = 83-86 
* B- = 80-82
* C+ = 77-79
* C  = 73-76
* C- = 70-72
* F  =  0-69

Late projects/assignments will receive half credit. No exceptions. So, find a way to turn in an assignment if you know you will be missing class.

## Academic Success

I believe every student who has been admitted to Baylor can be successful and I want to partner with you to help you thrive academically. Be sure to take advantage of the many resources available for academic success, including coming to see me during my office hours. Students who regularly utilize the great resources in the Paul L. Foster Success Center \([http://www.baylor.edu/successcenter/](http://www.baylor.edu/successcenter/)\) are among my most successful students. If your academic performance in this class is substandard, I will submit an Academic Progress Report to the Success Center so that the team of coordinated care professionals can ensure that you get the help you need. 

## First Generation College Students

Baylor University defines a first-generation college student as a student whose parents did not complete a four-year college degree. The First in Line program at Baylor is a support office on campus for first-generation college students to utilize if they have any questions or concerns. Please contact First in Line at firstinline@baylor.edu, call 254-710-6854, or visit [www.baylor.edu/firstinline](http://www.baylor.edu/firstinline) to learn more about the services available. 

## Academic Integrity

Plagiarism or any form of cheating involves a breach of student-teacher trust. This means that any work submitted under your name is expected to be your own, neither composed by anyone else as a whole or in part, nor handed over to another person for complete or partial revision.  Be sure to document all ideas that are not your own. Instances of plagiarism or any other act of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Honor Council and may result in failure of the course. Not understanding plagiarism is not an excuse. As a Baylor student, I expect you to be intimately familiar with the Honor Code at: [http://www.baylor.edu/honorcode/](http://www.baylor.edu/honorcode/)

## Students Needing Accommodations

Any student who needs academic accommodations related to a documented disability should inform me immediately at the beginning of the semester. You are required to obtain appropriate documentation and information regarding accommodations from the Office of Access and Learning Accommodation \(OALA\). Contact Information:  \(254\) 710-3605 - Paul L. Foster Success Center, 1st floor on the East Wing of Sid Richardson.
