# Introduction to Technology for Musicians

## Description

This technology course, designed specifically for musicians, balances quantitative technology knowledge with practical technology experience. There are **no** technological skill prerequisites _and_ I do not assume you have any technology skills or knowledge. This course includes fundamentals of: computer science, sound synthesis, notation software, sound reinforcement, digital audio recording/mixing/editing, copyright/licensing, graphic design, photography, and videography.

## Course Objective: **empower musicians with digital and media literacy.**
