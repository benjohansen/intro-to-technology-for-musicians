# Class05

## Intro to Logic

* **start with ES E \(virtual instrument\)**
  * vibrato is a modulator LFO changing the pitch of the oscillator at a selected frequency
  * Automation
    * Latch first .... then use Touch on subsequent recordings
  * add Modulation &gt; Tremolo audio effect plugin \(could have been part of the synth\)
  * add Modulation &gt; Modulation Delay
  * add Reverb &gt; Space Designer \(warped moving\)
* **introduce Sculpture \(Modeling Synth\)** ... from Logic Pro Help document:
  * > Also known as _physical modeling,_ this synthesis method uses mathematical models to simulate instruments. Parameters are used to describe the physical characteristics of an instrument, such as the materials the instrument is made of, the dimensions of the instrument, and the environment it is played in—under water, or in the air, for example. Equally important are descriptions of how the player would interact with the instrument—whether it is played by blowing; by plucking, bowing, or strumming strings; by hitting it with sticks; by placing fingers on sound holes, and so on.

## Might have to be at later date:

Draw diagram of a voltage controlled synth during class on a whiteboard \(?\)
