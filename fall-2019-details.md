* Roxy Grove, Meadows Hall, etc.

## Required Attendance Outside of Scheduled Class Time

None.

## Course Materials

All course materials \(textbooks, equipment, supplies, etc.\) will be supplied for you.

## Attendance

The following is straight from the School of Music Undergraduate Handbook:

> School of Music policy requires that to earn credit in a course a student must be officially enrolled by the end of the second full week of the semester and attend at least 75% of all class meetings. Faculty members may establish additional attendance requirements as outlined in course syllabi. Any student who is not present for at least 75% of the scheduled class sessions for any course will automatically receive a grade of “F” in the course. Any University-related activity necessitating an absence from class **will count** as an absence when determining whether a student has attended the required 75% of class meetings.

* Missing 20min of any portion of a class meeting will result in a 1/2 absence.
* Attendance is not calculated in your grade \(but you must attend at least 75% of class meetings to pass the course; those that miss more than 6 of the 27 classes fail the course\).

## Grading

Your final grade will be calculated out of the following. Notice half your grade is based on technology experiences \(creative technology projects\) and half your grade is based on quantitative measures \(quizzes/final exam\).

* 50% Creative Technology Projects
* 25% Quizzes \(from portions of Final Exam printed at the end of this syllabus;                   lowest quiz grade will be dropped\)
* 25% Cumulative Final Exam \(provided at the end of this syllabus\)

### Fall 2019 Final Exam:

* 12/12 9:00-11:00am = Section 1 \(MW class\) Final Exam in Alinea
* 12/16 4:30- 6:30pm = Section 2 \(TR class\) Final Exam in Alinea

### Grade Scale:

* A  = 90-100
* B+ = 87-89
* B  = 83-86 
* B- = 80-82
* C+ = 77-79
* C  = 73-76
* C- = 70-72
* F  =  0-69

Late projects/assignments will receive half credit. No exceptions. So, find a way to turn in an assignment if you know you will be missing class.

If you are not present to take a quiz, you receive zero credit for the quiz. No exceptions. You may, though, take a quiz early if you know you will miss class. Note: lowest quiz grade \(even a non-taken quiz\) will be dropped.

## Academic Success

I believe every student who has been admitted to Baylor can be successful and I want to partner with you to help you thrive academically. Be sure to take advantage of the many resources available for academic success, including coming to see me during my office hours. Students who regularly utilize the great resources in the Paul L. Foster Success Center \([http://www.baylor.edu/successcenter/](http://www.baylor.edu/successcenter/)\) are among my most successful students. If your academic performance in this class is substandard, I will submit an Academic Progress Report to the Success Center so that the team of coordinated care professionals can ensure that you get the help you need. 

## First Generation College Students

Baylor University defines a first-generation college student as a student whose parents did not complete a four-year college degree. The First in Line program at Baylor is a support office on campus for first-generation college students to utilize if they have any questions or concerns. Please contact First in Line at firstinline@baylor.edu, call 254-710-6854, or visit [www.baylor.edu/firstinline](http://www.baylor.edu/firstinline) to learn more about the services available. 

## Academic Integrity

Plagiarism or any form of cheating involves a breach of student-teacher trust. This means that any work submitted under your name is expected to be your own, neither composed by anyone else as a whole or in part, nor handed over to another person for complete or partial revision.  Be sure to document all ideas that are not your own. Instances of plagiarism or any other act of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Honor Council and may result in failure of the course. Not understanding plagiarism is not an excuse. As a Baylor student, I expect you to be intimately familiar with the Honor Code at: [http://www.baylor.edu/honorcode/](http://www.baylor.edu/honorcode/)

## Students Needing Accommodations

Any student who needs academic accommodations related to a documented disability should inform me immediately at the beginning of the semester. You are required to obtain appropriate documentation and information regarding accommodations from the Office of Access and Learning Accommodation \(OALA\). Contact Information:  \(254\) 710-3605 - Paul L. Foster Success Center, 1st floor on the East Wing of Sid Richardson.

## Baylor University Title IX

> Baylor University does not discriminate on the basis of sex or gender in any of its education or employment programs and activities, and it does not tolerate discrimination or harassment on the basis of sex or gender.

The Title IX office understands the sensitive nature of these situations and can provide information about available on- and off-campus resources, such as counseling and psychological services, medical treatment, academic support, university housing, and other forms of assistance that may be available. Staff members at the office can also explain your rights and procedural options if you contact the Title IX Office. You will not be required to share your experience. **If** **you or** **someone you know feels unsafe or** **may be in** **imminent danger, please call the Baylor Police** **Department \(254-710-2222\) or Waco** **Police Department \(9-1-1\) immediately.** For more information on the Title IX Office, the Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and Interpersonal Violence policy, reporting, and resources available, please visit [www.baylor.edu/titleix](http://www.baylor.edu/titleix).
