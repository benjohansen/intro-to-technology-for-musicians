  There are many other fine products out their that may very well be better than
  these, but I can vouch for the dependability of these items based on my years
  of experience using them.

# Hardware Suggestions

## Audio Interfaces:

* best bang for the buck = [Focusrite](https://focusrite.com/) interfaces
* best professional, "future proof" = [Metric Halo](https://mhsecure.com/) interfaces

## Portable Audio Recorders:

* best bang for the buck = [Zoom](https://www.zoom-na.com/) H series audio recorders
  * as of 2019: stick with series numbers 4 and above \(H4n, H5, H6\); the H1 is not good
* professional, still affordable, hardware limiters, and blows Zoom recorders out of the water = [Sound Devices](https://www.sounddevices.com/) MixPre series

## Microphones:

* for use in live situations \(with a PA system\) = [Shure SM58](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm58)
* solid, dependable, affordable microphones of all kinds = [Røde](https://www.rode.com/)

## Microphone Stands:

* solid microphone stands worth the money = [König & Meyer](https://www.k-m.de/en/)
  * I especially like the $60 [K&M 21070](https://www.k-m.de/en/products/mic-stands/floor-stands/21070-microphone-stand-black/21070-300-55)
